# FirstProject
TOP-FirstProject


This will be my first "From scratch" project. Feeling a bit overwhelmed, but I do hope tu put the skills Ive learned to good use without many hiccups.
==================================

Project is finished. Only asked for help once with a pretty simple thing so I am proud of myself for that, however can not say that it is perfect, feel like I made some mistakes. Text and h1/2/3 gaps are not perfect,not sure how to fix those without ruining the whole layout. But yea, I feel like I did a good job overall.
